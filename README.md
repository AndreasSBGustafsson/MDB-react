📚 Project Description
This project was developed as part of a frontend development course and serves as a personal student project aimed at building a database-like application for movie and actor information. The app is built with React, Vite, and TypeScript, and fetches data from the TMDB API.

🚀 Features & Technologies
	•	Displays movies and actors using carousels and cards
	•	Includes pagination, filtering, and sorting functionality
	•	Uses custom React hooks to fetch data such as genres, popular and trending movies
	•	Global state is handled with the Context API
	•	Styling is managed using SCSS
	•	The application is fully typed with TypeScript
	•	Vite is used as the build tool for fast and optimized development

📁 Project Structure (example)
The source folder is organized into reusable and scalable modules:
	•	components (Carousels, Pagination, Spinners)
	•	context (for global state)
	•	hooks (custom data-fetching logic)
	•	pages (for routing views like home, results, etc.)
	•	services (API calls)
	•	types (TypeScript interfaces and types)
	•	utils (shared utility functions)

🧠 What I Learned
	•	How to structure a medium-to-large scale React project
	•	Building reusable and modular components
	•	Fetching and managing external API data
	•	Writing type-safe code using TypeScript
	•	Managing application state with the Context API

📌 Notes
	•	This project is not optimized for production
	•	The codebase is relatively large due to experimentation and learning
	•	There are areas for improvement in structure and code reusability
	•	The goal of the project is to demonstrate the breadth of my learning
